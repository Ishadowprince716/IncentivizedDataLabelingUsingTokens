# Incentivized Data Labeling Using Tokens

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
Incentivized Data Labeling Using Tokens

## ðŸ§¾ Project Description
This project introduces a decentralized method for crowdsourcing labeled data using blockchain technology. Participants label data and earn tokens as a reward. The use of smart contracts ensures transparency, trust, and automated incentive distribution.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision
To revolutionize the data labeling process by leveraging blockchain to create a fair, open, and decentralized ecosystem where contributors are directly rewarded for their work. This will increase both the quantity and quality of labeled datasets available for machine learning and AI applications.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Decentralized Incentivization**: Automatically reward contributors with tokens.
- **Transparency & Trust**: All contributions and rewards are recorded on-chain.
- **Simplicity**: Lightweight contract with minimal functions for maximum efficiency and low gas costs.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- **Tokenomics**: Integration with ERC-20 token standards for broader use.
- **Reputation System**: Introduce trust scores for labelers based on their accuracy.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Let the community validate labeled data.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Enable purchase of labeled datasets with tokens.
- **AI Model Training**: Automate model training on labeled datasets in a decentralized environment.
